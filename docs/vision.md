### **Vision and Objectives for VitalEdge Flask**

---

#### **Vision**

**VitalEdge Flask** is an internal user interface (UI) designed to enable direct interaction with the omics data and pipelines managed by VitalEdge Beaker. As an integral part of the VitalEdge ecosystem, Flask focuses on providing researchers, clinicians, and administrators with intuitive tools to view, edit, and manage omics datasets, bioinformatics workflows, and associated metadata. By streamlining manual interventions and data visualization, Flask enhances operational efficiency and supports high-quality data stewardship in genomics.

#### **Objectives**

1. **Direct Interaction with Omics Data**
   - Provide users with the ability to view, query, and update genomic and related datasets stored in Beaker.
   - Enable rapid exploration of omics data, including subjects, studies, and variant details.

2. **User-Friendly Management Tools**
   - Offer intuitive tools for entering, editing, and validating new data, such as study details and annotations.
   - Ensure edits made through the UI are reflected in the Beaker database with appropriate validations and logging.

3. **Support for Bioinformatics Pipelines**
   - Provide interfaces to monitor and control bioinformatics pipelines, such as RxGen.
   - Enable users to view pipeline statuses and trigger manual execution or re-runs of specific steps when needed.

4. **Enhanced Data Visualization**
   - Include screens for visualizing the relationships between studies, subjects, and variants.
   - Provide flexible views of data to facilitate manual curation and interpretation.

5. **Audit and Provenance**
   - Track changes made through the Flask UI, linking user actions to specific data modifications.
   - Display provenance information to users for transparency and compliance with data governance standards.

6. **Integration with the VitalEdge Ecosystem**
   - Ensure seamless interaction with other VitalEdge components, such as the Beaker backend and Datalake APIs.
   - Support workflows that bridge multiple systems, such as moving data from Beaker to Datalake.

7. **Security and Role-Based Access**
   - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data or features.
   - Provide granular access control to different parts of the UI based on user roles.

8. **Support for Experimental Data and Workflows**
   - Enable users to upload raw or intermediate data for exploratory workflows.
   - Provide forms and utilities for testing new bioinformatics pipeline steps or parameters before deployment.

9. **Rapid Debugging and Troubleshooting**
   - Provide tools to help developers and administrators debug data or pipeline issues through targeted queries and manual operations.
   - Display logs, errors, and other diagnostic details in a user-friendly format.

10. **Modular Design for Future Expansion**
    - Use a flexible architecture that allows the addition of new pages, forms, and workflows with minimal disruption.
    - Support the inclusion of new data types, pipelines, or integration points as the VitalEdge system evolves.

11. **Facilitate Collaboration**
    - Allow multiple users to work on the same dataset or pipeline workflows concurrently with clear communication of changes and ownership.
    - Provide tagging, annotation, and commenting features for datasets to enhance team collaboration.

12. **Comprehensive Testing and Validation**
    - Include tools to verify the integrity and consistency of data before it is used in downstream analyses or shared with external systems.
    - Allow users to validate data transformations or pipeline outputs through automated or semi-automated checks.

#### **Key Features**

- **Omics Data Management**: View, edit, and validate studies, subjects, and variants directly within the UI.
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline progress and manually intervene in specific steps if necessary.
- **Data Visualization**: Simplify the exploration of relationships between genomic studies, subjects, and phenotypes.
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly interfaces for resolving errors in pipelines or datasets.

#### **Future Goals**

1. **Enhanced Visualizations**:
   - Integrate advanced visualization libraries to display genomic data and pipeline progress in more intuitive formats.
   
2. **Interoperability with AI/ML**:
   - Enable users to run or configure machine learning models directly from Flask, leveraging data from Beaker or Datalake.

3. **Streamlined Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Allow users to orchestrate complex workflows that span multiple systems, such as combining Beaker and Datalake data for machine learning.

4. **Mobile Support**:
   - Adapt the UI for mobile or tablet use, allowing administrators to interact with VitalEdge systems remotely.

#### **Key Outcomes**

- **For Researchers**: Accelerated data exploration and validation workflows.
- **For Clinicians**: Improved data accuracy and curation for downstream clinical use.
- **For Developers and Administrators**: A centralized interface for managing and troubleshooting omics pipelines and data.
